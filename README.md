# Partneropoly

## Overview

Partneropoly is a board game where players learn by negotiating the challenges of partner relationships in business. Do not pass "Go" and do not collect $200. Do have fun avoiding bankruptcy by eliminating toil and inefficiency!

## What's here

We're just getting started, so there's not much here yet. The plan is to use this repo to collaborate on creating the board artwork and game pieces. We'll get rolling with some vector graphics files and maybe even some solid models for 3D printing. If we're feeling particularly ambitious, maybe we'll vibe code some HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create a dynamic game board to put up on the projector screen. Stay tuned!
